### Introduction

Pokedapp-Lisk is a decentralized gaming platform that brings the excitement of Pokémon to the blockchain. Leveraging Lisk's Layer 2 network based on Optimism (OP), Pokedapp-Lisk enables users to buy, sell, and battle Pokémon cards in a trustless and secure environment.

### Elevator Pitch

"Pokedapp-Lisk: Unleash Your Pokémon Adventure on the Blockchain!"

### Inspiration

Pokedapp-Lisk draws inspiration from the immense popularity and cultural significance of Pokémon. By combining the world of Pokémon with blockchain technology, the project aims to provide users with an immersive and decentralized gaming experience.

### What It Does

Pokedapp-Lisk allows users to upload, purchase, and trade Pokémon cards on the Lisk L2 Testnet. Users can build their collection of cards, participate in auctions, and engage in battles with other trainers. The platform provides a seamless and immersive gaming experience, combining the excitement of collecting Pokémon with the benefits of blockchain technology.

### How We Built It

We built Pokedapp-Lisk using Solidity smart contracts for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), deployed on the Lisk L2 Testnet. The frontend interface was developed using React.js to provide a user-friendly experience. Integration with Lisk's Layer 2 network ensures fast and cost-efficient transactions, enabling smooth gameplay and interactions.

### Challenges We Ran Into

During development, challenges included designing and implementing complex smart contracts for card ownership, auctions, and battle mechanics. Optimizing the user experience while ensuring security and scalability on the Lisk network posed additional challenges. However, through collaboration and perseverance, we overcame these obstacles and delivered a functional gaming platform.

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We're proud to have created a decentralized gaming platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with the world of Pokémon. Pokedapp-Lisk offers a unique opportunity for users to collect and trade digital Pokémon cards while enjoying exciting battles in a decentralized environment. Our team's dedication and collaboration were key to bringing this project to life within the hackathon timeframe.

### What We Learned

Developing Pokedapp-Lisk provided valuable insights into blockchain gaming, smart contract development, and the capabilities of Lisk's Layer 2 network. We gained hands-on experience in deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the Lisk L2 Testnet, as well as implementing gaming mechanics. Additionally, we learned about the potential of decentralized applications to revolutionize the gaming industry.

### What's Next for Pokedapp-Lisk

Looking ahead, we plan to enhance Pokedapp-Lisk with additional features such as expanding the card collection, implementing advanced battle mechanics, and integrating social features like leaderboards and tournaments. Thorough testing and optimization will ensure a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience for users. Ultimately, we envision Pokedapp-Lisk becoming a leading decentralized gaming platform, attracting Pokémon enthusiasts worldwide.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
